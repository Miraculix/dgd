NAME
	mdbm_close - close a mdbm database.

SYNOPSIS
	int mdbm_close(int handle)


DESCRIPTION
	Close a mdbm database that has previously been opened by a call to
	the mdbm_open kfun.  The "handle" returned by that kfun is used as 
	an argument to this kfun.  
	Zero is returned to indicate failure, one to indicate success;
	although in general the return value may be ignored unless there is
	some uncertainty that the "handle" being used corresponds to an open
	database.
