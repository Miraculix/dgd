NAME
	mdbm_nextkey - Get the "next" key from a mdbm database

SYNOPSIS
	string mdbm_nextkey(int handle, string key)


DESCRIPTION
	Returns the "next" key after the given key in an mdbm database 
	has previously been opened by a call to the mdbm_open kfun.  
	The "handle" returned by that kfun is used as an argument to this kfun.
	Zero is returned to indicate failure.

NOTES
	The order of keys in a database isn't based on anything interesting.

	Deleting a key changes the order of the keys in a database, so be
	careful of such changes in the midst of firstkey/nextkey loops over
	the database as such a change may mean that all keys are not visited
	in the loop.
