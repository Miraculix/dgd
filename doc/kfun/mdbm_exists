NAME
	mdbm_exists - check the validity of a handle or existence of a key in
		      a mdbm database.

SYNOPSIS
	varargs int mdbm_exists(int handle, string key)


DESCRIPTION
	When called with a "handle" only this kfun will return one if the
	"handle" given corresponds to an open mdbm database, zero otherwise.

	When called with both a "handle" and a key this kfun checks for the
	existence of such a key in a mdbm database that has previously been 
	opened by a call to the mdbm_open kfun.  The "handle" returned by 
	that kfun is used as an argument to this kfun.  Zero is returned to 
	indicate failure, one to indicate success.
