NAME
	mdbm_reorganize - Reorganize a mdbm database file.

SYNOPSIS
	int mdbm_reorganize(int handle)


DESCRIPTION
	In general the file associated with a mdbm database will not shrink
	after key/value deletions (although the space will be reused for
	future insertions).  After a large number of deletions this kfun
	may be called to shrink the size of that associated file. 
	The database must have been previously opened by a call to the
	mdbm_open kfun.  The "handle" returned by that kfun is used as an 
	argument to this kfun.
	Zero is returned to indicate failure, one to indicate success.

NOTES
	The execution of this function is expensive and it should be used
	sparingly.

	This kfun is only available is the mdbm package has been compiled to
	use gdbm rather than ndbm databases.
