NAME
	mdbm_open - open a mdbm database.

SYNOPSIS
	int mdbm_open(string database_file)


DESCRIPTION
 	An mdbm database is either a gdbm or ndbm database, depending on the
	compile time options used in the driver.  Such a database may be
	manipulated after first opening it by calling this kfun with the name
	of the database file.  An integer "handle" which is used to refer to 
	the database after opening is returned, zero indicating failure.

NOTES
	If the driver is configured to use ndbm databases the name of the
	database file should be used without ".dir" or ".pag" extensions.
