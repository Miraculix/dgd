NAME
	mdbm_store - store a key/value pair in a mdbm database.

SYNOPSIS
	varargs int mdbm_store(int handle, string key, string value, int flag)


DESCRIPTION
	Store a key/value pair in a mdbm database that has previously been 
	opened by a call to the mdbm_open kfun.  The "handle" returned by 
	that kfun is used as an argument to this kfun.  

	If the key already exists in the mdbm database then by default its
	previous value is replaced by the value passed to this kfun.  If the
	optional flag is present and non-zero the value is not replaced.

	Zero is returned to indicate failure, one to indicate success.
